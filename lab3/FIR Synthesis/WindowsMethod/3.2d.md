### Stability of Filters

The stability of a filter is a crucial aspect of its design and performance, particularly in digital signal processing. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the stability considerations for the filters discussed, including the rectangular filter and the windowed version.

#### 1. **FIR Filters (Finite Impulse Response)**
- **Stability**: FIR filters, such as the rectangular filter created using the Windows method, are inherently stable. This is because they do not have feedback elements; their output is solely based on a finite number of input samples. 
- **Poles**: FIR filters have no poles in the z-plane (or all poles are at the origin), which means they cannot produce unbounded outputs. The absence of poles ensures that the filter will always be stable regardless of the input signal.

#### 2. **Windowed FIR Filters**
- **Stability**: When you apply a window (like Hamming or Kaiser) to the impulse response of an FIR filter, the resulting filter remains FIR and thus retains the stability characteristics of the original filter. The windowing process modifies the frequency response but does not introduce any feedback or poles that could lead to instability.
- **Effect of Windowing**: The windowing process typically reduces side lobes in the frequency response, which can improve the filter's performance in terms of reducing artifacts in the output signal. However, it does not affect the stability of the filter.

#### 3. **IIR Filters (Infinite Impulse Response)**
- **Stability**: In contrast to FIR filters, IIR filters can be unstable. The stability of IIR filters depends on the location of their poles in the z-plane. For an IIR filter to be stable, all poles must lie inside the unit circle. If any pole lies on or outside the unit circle, the filter can produce unbounded outputs, leading to instability.
- **Design Considerations**: When designing IIR filters, careful attention must be paid to pole placement to ensure stability.

### Conclusion
- **FIR Filters**: The rectangular filter and its windowed version are stable by design. They do not have poles that could lead to instability, making them suitable for applications where stability is critical.
- **IIR Filters**: If you were to design an IIR filter, you would need to analyze the pole locations to ensure stability. This is not a concern for the FIR filters discussed here.

In summary, the filters you have designed (the rectangular filter and the windowed version) are stable, and you can confidently use them in applications without the risk of producing unbounded outputs.
