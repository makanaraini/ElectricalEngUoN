The stability of digital filters is determined by the location of their poles in the z-plane. Hereâ€™s how to assess the stability of the Butterworth, Chebyshev Type I, and Chebyshev Type II filters based on the poles obtained from the previous MATLAB code.

### Stability Criteria
1. **Digital Filters**: A digital filter is stable if all its poles lie inside the unit circle in the z-plane. This means that the magnitude of each pole must be less than 1 (i.e., \( |P_i| < 1 \) for all poles \( P_i \)).
2. **Analogue Filters**: For analogue filters, stability is determined by the location of poles in the s-plane. A stable analogue filter has all poles in the left half of the s-plane.

### Analysis of the Filters
1. **Butterworth Filter**:
   - The Butterworth filter is designed to have a maximally flat frequency response in the pass-band. 
   - If all poles of the Butterworth filter are located inside the unit circle, the filter is stable. Given that Butterworth filters are typically designed to be stable, it is expected that the poles will lie within the unit circle.

2. **Chebyshev Type I Filter**:
   - Chebyshev Type I filters allow for ripple in the pass-band, which can lead to a more aggressive roll-off compared to Butterworth filters.
   - Similar to the Butterworth filter, if all poles of the Chebyshev Type I filter are inside the unit circle, the filter is stable. However, the presence of ripple can sometimes lead to poles being closer to the unit circle, so it is essential to check their locations.

3. **Chebyshev Type II Filter**:
   - Chebyshev Type II filters have a flat pass-band but allow ripple in the stop-band. 
   - Like the other filters, stability is determined by the location of the poles. If all poles are inside the unit circle, the filter is stable. Chebyshev Type II filters are also designed to be stable, but the pole locations should be verified.

### Conclusion
- **Stability Check**: After running the MATLAB code, you can check the output for the poles of each filter. If all poles are within the unit circle (i.e., their magnitudes are less than 1), then the filter is stable.
- **Expected Stability**: 
  - **Butterworth Filter**: Generally stable due to its design.
  - **Chebyshev Type I Filter**: Typically stable, but check pole locations.
  - **Chebyshev Type II Filter**: Also typically stable, but verify pole locations.

### Example MATLAB Code to Check Stability
You can add the following code snippet after calculating the poles to check the stability of each filter:

```matlab
% Check stability of Butterworth filter
is_stable_butter = all(abs(p_butter) < 1);
disp(['Butterworth Filter is stable: ', num2str(is_stable_butter)]);

% Check stability of Chebyshev Type I filter
is_stable_cheby1 = all(abs(p_cheby1) < 1);
disp(['Chebyshev Type I Filter is stable: ', num2str(is_stable_cheby1)]);

% Check stability of Chebyshev Type II filter
is_stable_cheby2 = all(abs(p_cheby2) < 1);
disp(['Chebyshev Type II Filter is stable: ', num2str(is_stable_cheby2)]);
```

### Running the Stability Check
When you run this code, it will output whether each filter is stable based on the pole locations. If all poles are within the unit circle, the output will confirm that the filter is stable. If any poles are on or outside the unit circle, the filter is considered unstable.
