% Step 1: Define the open-loop transfer function (OLTF)
num = 1; % Numerator of GH(s)
den = conv([1 0], conv([1 2], [1 4])); % Denominator of GH(s) = s(s+2)(s+4)

% Display the open-loop transfer function
disp('Open-Loop Transfer Function GH(s):');

% Step 3: Plot the root locus

% Step 4: Find the gain K for the desired damping ratio
disp('Click on the root locus to select the desired pole location.');

fprintf('Selected Gain K = %.2f\n', K);

% Step 5: Display the closed-loop poles
disp('Closed-Loop Poles:');

% Step 6: Check if multiple values of K satisfy the condition
% The root locus plot will show if multiple points correspond to zeta = 0.5
% If the root locus intersects the zeta = 0.5 line at multiple points,
% multiple values of K will satisfy the condition.

% Step 7: Verify the damping ratio of the selected poles
theta = acos(zeta); % Angle corresponding to zeta = 0.5
desired_angle = theta * 180/pi; % Convert to degrees

% Calculate the angle of the selected poles
pole_angles = angle(poles) * 180/pi; % Convert to degrees

% Check if the selected poles have the desired damping ratio
